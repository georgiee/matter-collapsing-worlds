      <h1>favorite gadgets of 2018</h1>
      <p>
          It’s been quite a long year. Aside from all of the various world events that have happened, there’s also been a lot of... stuff released. And we’ve reviewed almost all of it. New phones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, cars, gaming PCs... you name it, we’ve probably reviewed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So for our end of the year round up, we decided to forego the traditional categorical rankings and instead tell you about our favorite gadgets of the year. These aren’t the best gadgets, these are our favorites. Enjoy!

          There’s no doubt that Mr. Trump was upset about conservatives trashing him for <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/'>flirting</a> with a wall-free spending bill. This president is driven by an insatiable need for adulation. The less popular he becomes with the bulk of the nation, the more vital it is for him — emotionally and politically — to keep his base happy.

      <h2>Shutdown? More Like a Breakdown</h2>

          But it’s also true that revving up the wall fight allows Mr. Trump to divert attention from so much of the other drama threatening to swallow him up.

          Faced with all that, who wouldn’t rather throw himself into a fight — maybe even shut down parts of the government — over a border wall? At least with his wall, Mr. Trump gets to pretend that he is still in control, even as his administration sinks further and further into the swamp.
