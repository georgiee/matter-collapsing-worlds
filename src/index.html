        <h3>More Headlines to save them</h3>
        <p class="probe2">
            There’s no doubt that Mr. Trump was upset about conservatives trashing him for <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/'>flirting</a> with a wall-free spending bill. This president is <span>driven</span> by an <em>insatiable need for adulation</em>. The less popular he becomes with the bulk of the nation, the more vital it is for him — <strong>emotionally</strong> and politically — to keep his base happy.

      <h2>Shutdown? More Like a Breakdown</h2>
      <p>
          But it’s also true that revving up the wall fight allows Mr. Trump to divert attention from so much of the other drama threatening to swallow him up.
      <img src="https://picsum.photos/g/700/300?image=577"/>
      <p>
          Faced with all that, who wouldn’t rather throw himself into a fight — maybe even shut down parts of the government — over a border wall? At least with his wall, Mr. Trump gets to pretend that he is still in control, even as his administration sinks further and further into the swamp.
